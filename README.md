# Password Generator Starter Code

##This assignment was very challenging. A lot of back and forth to find out what was needed. Working with Javascript is not easy.

The starter code was expanded with new variables added and new if statements.
There were places i believe things could be simplified with while loops but i need to expand my knowledge to implement that.
**Code**
1. Add functions to run code.
2. Create variables with arrays of all possible characters.
3. Create variables and to create prompts.
4. Create if statements that help to create.
5. Create password values to match pre-existing code.
